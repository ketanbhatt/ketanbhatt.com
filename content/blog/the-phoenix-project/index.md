Some notes from [The Phoenix Project][1]

1. **See a disaster coming:** Sometimes we turn a blind eye to the unknowns, thinking we will figure them out when we come to that, but it doesn't work most of the times (personal note: think "daywise system"). It is better to call out the mess and re-align. Of course it is even better to see it coming before you even start building.
2. **Prioritize:** The more you have in WIP, the more your dates will shift. Keep WIP small.
3. **Improving daily work is even more important than doing daily work.** Properly elevate preventive work.
4. **Repetition creates habits, and habits are what enables mastery.** Whether youâ€™re talking about sports training, learning a musical instrument, or training in the Special Forces, nothing is more important for mastery than practice and drills. Studies have shown that practicing five minutes daily is better than practicing once a week for three hours. And if you want to create a genuine culture of improvement, you must create those habits.
